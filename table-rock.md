route-info: You don't have to go far from the city to get on a great climb. Table Rock is the prominent cliff-forming mesa located directly E. of downtown. Try to spin up during the short approach. The grades are relatively continuous and manageable until the final 200-300 m approach to the topout. Your efforts are rewarded with one of the best views of the valley. Use the photo spot as an excuse to rest near the top, or snag it on your way down.
route-directions: From the District or ā café head east on Main St. for a nice flyby of downtown Boise. Turn left onto Broadway at the hospital. Continue thru an intersection under the sky walk that connects the red-brick hospital campus. Look out for large polygon figures of a fox and a bear on your right side. Enter the incipient roundabout and and take the first exit onto Shaw Mtn. Road. Continue on Shaw Mtn. until the top, being sure to take the soft-right when the road forks about half-way up.
