route-desc: Three climbs for blessings
route-info: "This route will bless you with three climbs: Le Col du Harrison Nord, Warm Springs Mesa, and Table Rock. This is a great route for the winter when you want to get in some climbing, but the snow line is low. Or if you don't want to travel far from the city."
route-directions: We start at District and head east on Boise Avenue. The ride is flat and pleasant with a wide bike lane and good views of the foothills to the north. We cross the Boise River on Eckert Rd near Barber Park. There is a nice stretch of tarmac here to open up short sprint efforts. You want to get the legs warmed up for the first climb—The Col du Harris North, which features double-digit grades. Turn left off Eckert Rd onto Parkcenter Blvd, but hang right on Warm Springs Ave soon after. Another immediate right off Warm Springs onto Harris Ranch Rd. should have you heading towards the foothills. Keep your eyes to the right and you will see the steep ascent up Harris Nord. Descend Harris the same way you got up and turn right onto Warm Springs Ave. Hug the foothills to your right as you head NW on Warm Springs Ave. The second climb—Warm Springs Mesa—has a hidden sharp-right onto Starview Dr. It's easy to get lost on the Mesa, but just keep turning your bike uphill and you will have a nice time. Keep climbing and heading NW and you will eventually descend back onto Warm Springs Ave. Continue NW towards the city, past the Old Penitentiary until you hit the large intersection with Broadway Ave. Take the right onto Broadway and continue until you hit the roundabout, where you will exit to the right onto Reserve St. Continue on Reserve until you start turning up again on Shaw Mtn Rd. You are now on the final climb of the day, Table Rock. Enjoy the blessings and the views. you are saved.
